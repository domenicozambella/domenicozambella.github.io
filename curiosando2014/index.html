<h3>Torino 28 aprile 2014</h3>

<h3>Una Giornata</h3>

<h1>Curiosando nella Matematica</h1>

<h1>Browsing through Mathematics</h1>

<div class="cappello">
This is a series of talks aimed at students in mathematics. They are meant to stimulate curiosity and interest in topics that are rarely mentioned in regular lectures.<br/><br/>

They range over diverse areas of mathematics and they require little to no background knowledge.<br/><br/>

The talks will be given by staff of the Department of Mathematics and a few PhD students. None of the speakers are receiving any compensation, so we would like to express our gratitude to all of them.<br/><br/>

For printing, find here the <a href="curiosando2014.pdf">POSTER</a> and the <a href="abstracts.pdf">ABSTRACTS</a>.

       <b>Abstract:</b> 
       We will follow Cantor's basic development of the theory of cardinalities. This theory generalizes to infinite collections the notion of <em>number</em> meant as the quantity of elements of a given finite set of objects. We shall give the definition and basic properties of cardinal numbers and of the arithmetic operation of sum product and exponentiation between them. Finally we will focus  our attention on the continuum problem, which asks for a solution of an elementary question of cardinal arithmetic. Whilst formulated by Cantor in the second half of the 19th century, this problem was shown to be undecidable on the basis of the commonly accepted axioms of set theory by the combined work of Goedel and Cohen almost a century later and is still escaping a definite solution nowadays.

      <b>Abstract:</b> The list of fields in which maths is becoming an important tool is nowadays not limited to the traditional ones like physics and engineering,  but it is growing longer and longer, pushed by the need of quantitative predictions 
that is pervading many fields. Maths is closing the gap between idealized models  (both theoretical and in the 
lab, often oversimplified) and real-world experiments 
(more realistic,  but difficult to control, costly and sometimes limited on ethical  grounds).<br/><br/>

The conservation of cultural heritage is a typical example where in situ experiments are out of question: works of art are unique pieces and no experiment is allowed on them. For the very same reason, no restoration activity on a monument would be allowed on the basis of 
generic predictions. In between these two extrema, numerical mathematics and scientific computing are now providing tools to make predictions on the state of a work of art and on the evolution of the present damage 
that are taylored to that particular monument. 
This allows the planned conservation [1], a safer (and
cost effective) decision-making strategy for the management of the cultural heritage that is based on quantitative predictions.
In this seminar I will illustrate the case of marble sulfation: the chemical aggression  by sulfur oxides that damages marble monuments by turning their outer layer in a gypsum crust that easily blackens,  dissolves in rainwater or falls away for temperature induced stresses. 
A mathematical model that captures the main mechanism of this reaction is introduced [2]  and its sulutions numerically approximated: eventually one ends up with a large non-linear  system  that is solved with the Newton method [3], taking care of guaranteeing its  convergence  and of the fast resolution of the large linear system that  is required at each Newton step [4,5].

In its full generality it can not be solved nor in any way simplified into a system whose solutions can be expressed in closed form. We will try to understand the role of periodic orbits and symmetries in the description of the complexity of the system.

      <b>Abstract:</b>  How many people do you need to invite in a party in order to 
      have that either n of them mutually know each other or n of them
      mutually do not know each other? In 1930 F.P. Ramsey proved a theorem 
      (the Finite Ramsey Theorem ) which answers this question. In the same
      year he proved that if you have infinitely many people at a party then either
      there exists an infinite subset whose members all know each other or an
      an infinite subset none of whose members know each other, the Infinite
      Ramsey Theorem. These theorems are famous results in combinatorics,
      and they have many applications in different branches of mathematics.

      <b>Abstract:</b> Fourier Transform is a very powerful tool and it is the background of several techniques in signal analysis. Nevertheless, it has some drawbacks. Let us consider a music score, roughly speaking, Fourier Transform is able to determine with high precision which note (frequency) is played, but fails in detecting when (time) they are played. It is very precise in frequency, but loses completely time-resolution. In order to overcome this problem several new methods have been developed: STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform), CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform), ST (Stockwell Transform), Schearlets, Curvelets, Cohen Class distributions. 
      The idea behind these extensions is to introduce a new parameter which represents the time. In this way, the transform can represent the content of the signal in a certain frequency at a certain time. Heuristically, the aim is to reproduce the music pentagram which is exactly the representation of which notes (frequencies) are played in a fixed time. In the talk I will introduce some time-frequency transforms, focusing mainly on the Stockwell Transform. Then, I will explain how time-frequency analysis can be applied to image processing. Finally, I will show some applications of the Stockwell Transform to image processing. In particular to medical imaging, archeology and watermarking.

      <b>Abstract:</b> Random Graphs is an active area of research which combines probability theory and graph theory. The subject began in 1960 with the monumental paper "On the Evolution of Random graphs" by Paul Erd&ouml;s and Alfred R&eacute;nyi. At first, the study of random graphs was used to prove deterministic properties of graphs. For example, if we can show that a random graph has with a positive probability a certain property, then a graph must exist with this property. The method of proving deterministic statements using probabilistic arguments is called the probabilistic method.<br/><br/>The initial work by Erd&ouml;s and R&eacute;nyi on random graphs has incited a great amount of work on the field. Later, interest in random graphs of a different nature arose. Due to the increase of computer power, it has become possible to study so- called real networks. Despite the Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi model does not share all the properties of the networks, its analysis has been very important to understand and study new models.<br/><br/>This talk will show the Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi model and some of the most important results, also, some new models and their properties.

      <b>Abstract:</b> Everyone knows the Heron formula expressing the area of a triangle in function of its sides.<br/><br/> Starting from an elementary problem on triangles and using this formula, we will arrive to a third degree curve. Exploiting its meaning with respect to the starting problem, we will enter into a remarkable algebraic fact, which concerns such curves (called elliptic) and allows to introduce an operation on them that embodies a group structure.<br/><br/> This can be the starting point of different stories: from the issue of how many rational points do exist on these curves to the possibility of introducing applications to the cryptographic schemes behind secure financial transactions on the web. The elliptic curves have also a central role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and are central area of research in number theory. <br/><br/> The story shows the remarkable unity of mathematics, starting as it does in high school and ending in research. Along the way we will encounter a fundamental idea in modern mathematics: the idea of solving a problem about a particular type of object by situating the object in a more general space and finding the right way of parameterizing that space.
