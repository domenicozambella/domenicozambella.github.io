<h2>Scientific interests</h2>

<div style="padding-left:4ex;margin-top:-1ex;">
<h3>Computability and randomness</h3>

Can we explain randomness -a very elusive notion- with (un)computability? Kolmogorov made the first attempt to answer this question.  Building on it, Schnorr and Martin-L&ouml;f had the first important results. 

<div style=margin:-0.7ex;padding-top=0ex;>&nbsp;</div>

I made a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&cluster=10923142308970598764" title="On sequences with simple initial segments">seminal contribution</a> to the field (unpublished but highly cited because of two questions: the first answered by <a href="https://scholar.google.it/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=A.+Kucera+and+S.+A.+Terwijn%2C+Lowness+for+the+class+of+random+sets&btnG=" style="color:black">A.Kucera and S.A.Terwijn</a>, the second by <a href="https://scholar.google.it/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=A.+Nies+Lowness+properties+and+randomness.+&btnG=" style="color:black">A.Nies</a>). I have also written a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Terwijn+Zambella+Computational+randomness+and+lowness&btnG=" title="Computational randomness and lowness">paper</a> in collaboration with S.A.Terwijn.

<h3>Provability Logic</h3>

This field studies the algebraic properties of the provability predicate (i.e. of G&ouml;del's formalized provability formula). I <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Notre+Dame+Journal+of+Formal+Logic%2C+Zambella%2C+Shavrukov+Theorem+on+the+Subalgebras+of+Diagonalizable+Algebras+for+Theories+Containing&btnG=" title="Shavrukov's Theorem on the Subalgebras of Diagonalizable Algebras for Theories Containing IÎ”0+exp">contributed</a> to the field with a few papers during my PhD in Amsterdam.

<h3>Complexity theory and formal systems</h3>

In particular, Bounded Arithmetic. My most <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Notes+on+polynomially+bounded+arithmetic&as_sdt=0" title="Notes on polynomially bounded arithmetic">relevant contribution</a> to the field has been to establish a relation between the finite axiomatizability of Bounded Arithmetic and the collapse of the Polynomial Time Hierarchy. Cfr. <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jsl/1183745956">Stephen Cook's  review</a> of this and related results. This work was also part of my (heterogenous) PhD thesis.

<h3>Model theory</h3>

I have recently become interested in model theory. This is the field that studies the combinatorial properties of (first-order) definability.
<div style=margin:-0.7ex;padding-top=0ex;>&nbsp;</div>
I am writing a <a href="https://www.ams.org/open-math-notes/omn-view-listing?listingId=110738" title="A Cr&egrave;che Course in Model Theory">textbook</a> on the subject. I am also beginning with the supervision of a PhD project on applications of model theory to fields such as extremal/probabilistic combinatorics, additive combinatorics, pseudorandomness, etc. (recent results hint to deep connections).

<h3>Teaching</h3>

I enjoy teaching probability and statistics to molecular biologists. I am coordinating a project that applies <a href="http://jupyter.org/" style="color:black;"> Jupyter Notebooks</a> in teaching/presentation, laboratory classes, homework assignments, exams, etc. In this way the students --though attending a standard introductory course of statistics-- will have the opportunity to familiarize with a cutting edge technology that has applications ranging  from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exploration" style="color:black;">data exploration</a> to publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility" style="color:black;">reproducible research</a>.

<h2>PhD supervisions</h2>


<div style="padding-left:4ex;">

Together with Abderezak Ould Houcine of the Institut Camille Jordan, Universit&eacute; Claude Bernard-Lyon, I supervised the following PhD thesis<br><br>

Daniele A.G. Vallino, <a href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00739255">Algebraic and definable closure in free groups</a>
